My notes as I go through CFA material

## Mortgage-backed securities

- Bank re-sells loans (i.e. 1000s of loans that total to 1bn) to investment bank or institutional fund. Investment bank bought right to the principal and interest payments on loans
- Originating bank got fees for originating and then transferring loan
- Investment bank bundles loans into a special purpose vehicle, and then issues shares from this corporation. Hedge funds etc will buy shares and are entitled to dividends
- Each share is a mortgage backed security
- If default, the SPV will seize the house title. Sell off the house. They would estimate (for a given area or borrower profile) what the default rate is, and what the recovery rate is (i.e. how much can be recovered)

## Collateralized Debt Obligations

- Ratings agency assesses credit risk of loans in a mortgage backed security
- Split MBS into tranches (senior, mezzanine, equity tranche)
- Pensions can buy the Senior tranche (paid first but low yield, AAA and can buy insurance on credit)
- Mezzanine tranche (paid next, BB rating)
- Equity tranche (last to get paid, junk rating, but get 15% yield)

## Collateralized Loan Obligations

From Court Carlsen's video:

- CLO is a collection of loans which are packaged together and then split into groups with varying degrees of risk in return for higher interest rates for a more risky take on which are then sold off to various institutional investors
- Generally made up of corporate, junk-rated loans (first lien bank loans). "Safer" than equity if company were to go bankrupt.
- CLOs are a collection of 100 to 250 corporate loans, which are then packaged together by a CLO asset manager (e.g. blackrock, oaktree, bain capital)
- Junk bonds make up CLOs - either carry large amount of debt, or newer/smaller companies wiht less credit to their name
- CLOs make it easier for junk-rated companies to access capital by issuing more debt, allow companies to invest in themselves and continue to innovate.
- Why AA to BB are interesting: gives them more options. Have attractive risk-return ratio - "BB" tranche in CLO yields 5-6% vs <3% for high-yield corporate bonds
- Why Equity is interesting: 12-20% beats wide array of asset classes. Aggressive investments and higher yields, but high chance of default.
- CLOs are tied to LIBOR rate - attractive when interest rates are rising
- Janet Yellen - corporate indebtedness is very high, highly leveraged. Underwriting of debt is very weak, lending standards have dropped. Similar to CDOs and lack of transparency
- Ray Dalio - Private equity has been dumping money into CLOs, which is dangerous for equity tranche holders. Corporate debt levels are very high due to interest rates being very low (buy back stock, dividends, etc). If they use debt to buyback stock, if company earnings decline, they can't pay their debt
- PE firms have been raising a lot of money, a lot of which flows into CLOs. i.e. incentive to just buy any debt they can, mistaken belief that a CLO will protect people from defaults.
- Decrease in lending standards, as CLO "skin in the game" rule was lifted. CLO fund managers were required to have stake in CLO that they created. However - no longer needed a 5% stake in company
- Many loans are covenant-lite loans (i.e. fewer investor protections), without restrictions

- Wedding wineglass analogy (Paddy Hirsch). Senior, mezzanine, equity tranches (i.e. "waterfall")
- JPM ("agent") syndicates a corporate loan, breaks it up among investor tranches
- CLOs creator takes one of the investor tranches, and includes it with many other investor tranches. CLOs increase demand for investor tranches, ergo increases "agents" willingness to syndicate corporate loans
- CLOs are structured credit security collateralized by large portfolio of senior secured loans (i.e. sit at top of company's capital structure, first in line to get paid if bankruptcy) to high yield companies
- Cashflow from collateral (i.e. senior secured loans) is paid into SPV for CLO, which has differentiated claims from AAA Tranche (CLO Debt) to Equity tranche (first loss)

- If performance of CLO deteriorates, investors are protected by investor coverage ratio and overcollateralization. Traps excess proceeds which was supposed to be distributed to equity, and gives it to AAA tranches
- CLOs are a floating rate asset
- CLO liquidity is higher? More than hedge funds, now pension funds as well
- Need to analyze the underlying collateral, make sure they are companies that won't default. Work needed: loan portfolio may have 200 companies, needs credit analysts, legal staff, structured credit analysts. Underwriting process needs ot be the same from AAA to Equity. Need to review all collateral, all tests, all manager and counterparty risks.

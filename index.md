This is my Ethereum cheatsheet that I'll be adding to as my [tree of knowledge](https://lifehacker.com/elon-musk-on-learning-new-things-view-knowledge-as-a-t-1677850415). It's a live document that I'll be adding to regularly.

I am currently on a sabbatical from May 2019 - Aug 2019 to [learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/) with a focus on Ethereum and DeFi.

# Ethereum Cheatsheet
{: .fs-9 }

This is my Ethereum cheatsheet that I'll be adding to as my [tree of knowledge](https://lifehacker.com/elon-musk-on-learning-new-things-view-knowledge-as-a-t-1677850415). I am currently [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/) as part of my sabbatical from May 2019 - Aug 2019 to learn about Ethereum and Defi.
